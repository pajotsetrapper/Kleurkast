# Kleurkast
A project made to add some cool-factor to a kid's wardrobe.
Consists of:
- Receiver: Arduino controlling a WS2812b LED strip, mounted in a wardrobe with matte glass doors
- Sender: Remote control, allowing to select color by means of 3 potentiometers + buttons for effects, selecting manual/effect mode & turning off the light.

Communication is done by means of an NRF24L01+ module
